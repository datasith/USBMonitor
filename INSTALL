Clone this repo to any location on your Raspberry Pi.  I'll use for this example
the home holder of the default user (pi):

cd ~pi
git clone https://github.com/themakerbro/USBMonitor

Copy the sample configuration file:

cd ~/USBMonitor
cp config.json.sample config.json

Install required Python module:

sudo pip install pyudev

Add the following line to the rc.local file to run in the background after
startup:

env -i /usr/bin/python /home/pi/USBMonitor/main.py &

Debug by running from the command line:

sudo service rc.local start

Connect and disconnect a USB flash drive, its contents will be copied to the
XFER directory in this repository.  Any future copies will cleanout the contents of
the XFER directory.

Changes to the default names and options can be configured through the
config.json file.
